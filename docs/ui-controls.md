# UI Controls

This page describes the most common UI controls and how to use them.

Note that if you are using a mouse, **right click** - in the following instructions - is equivalent to **press and hold
**.

## Buttons

### Long click

![Button long click](img/generated/button-long-click-screenshot.png)

Buttons with an indicator (`...`) in the top right have a long-click action.
You can press and hold or right-click the button.

## Knobs

### Default behaviour

- **Drag** to change the value
- **Press and hold** to open a popup for more precise control
- **Double tap** to reset the value to the default

This behaviour can be configured in the [app settings](settings/app.md).

### Dragging

Knob values can be increased by dragging them up or to the right.
When dragging to the top right, the values will increase more rapidly.
To decrease the value just use the opposite direction as shown in the image below.

Drag the fader knob to change the value. If **fine mode** is enabled you can start dragging the fader from any position
and the movements will be more precise.

Additionally, you can tap the areas highlighted in red above to nudge the fader by 0.25db increments.
