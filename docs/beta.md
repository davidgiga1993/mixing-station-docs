# Beta program

The beta program allows you to test an upcoming version before anyone else.

## Discussion / Feedback

All discussion about the beta versions as well as general feedback happens in
our [discord channel](https://discord.gg/d8bJPg6kZm).
Feel free to join us!

## Android

If you want to join the program just follow the
link: [Mixing Station beta](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/org.devcore.mixingstation )

You will receive the beta version as a regular update from the Google Play Store.

To leave the beta group, just delete and reinstall the app from your device.

## iOS

Open this link on your iOS device and follow the instructions:

- [Test Flight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/lsd9mugy)

Note: Beta builds are only available for 90 days.
In that time, all in-app payment features can be **tested for free!** Just click on 'Buy' and it will show the price
as 0â‚¬. Previously made purchases won't be visible here as they are only for the release version of the app.

If you decide to leave the beta make sure to select the `Restore purchses` button (see below) to restore your previous
purchases.

The beta testers are limited to 750 accounts so if there are no slots left you can't join the beta program.

## Desktop

1. Open the app
2. Click the gear icon -> `Global`
3. Select `Beta` as update branch
4. Restart the app

## Mixer specific beta

This beta only applies to a single mixer series which should be tested.
These tests are required since I don't have access to the hardware and developed the
integration solely based on an emulator.

I'm very thankful for all the feedback I can get for those mixers.

This section will get updated based on the feedback I receive.

## Yamaha DM7

The Yamaha DM7 beta is available since Mixing Station `2.2.6`, use the `dm7` code for the secret mode dialog (see below).

## Secret Mode / Pre-release

The secret mode allows you to access unreleased features of the app.

You can open it by `double-tapping with two fingers` on the screen (on a free area!) after opening the app,
or by pressing `CTRL+D`.
This opens a new dialog where you can enter the code.
