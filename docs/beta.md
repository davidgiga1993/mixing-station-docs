# Beta program

The beta program allows you to test an upcoming version before anyone else.

## Discussion / Feedback

All discussion about the beta versions as well as general feedback happens in our [discord channel](https://discord.gg/d8bJPg6kZm). 
Feel free to join us!

## Android

If you want to join the program just follow the
link: [Mixing Station beta](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/org.devcore.mixingstation )

You will receive the beta version as a regular update from the Google Play store.

If you're still using the old Android app, make sure to read the [migration guide](../platforms/android/#migration).

To leave the beta group, just delete and reinstall the app from your device.

## iOS

Open this link on your iOS device and follow the instructions:

Note: Beta builds are only available for 90 days. In that time, all in-app payment features can be **tested for free!**
The beta testers are limited to 750 accounts so if there are no slots left you can't join the beta program.

## Desktop

1. Open the app
2. Click the gear icon
3. Select `Beta` as update branch
4. Restart the app

## Mixer specific beta

This beta only applies to a single mixer series which should be tested.
These tests are required since I don't have access to the hardware and developed the
integration solely based on an emulator.

I'm very thankful for all the feedback I can get for those mixers.

This section will get updated based on the feedback I receive.

## Secret Mode / Pre-release
The secret mode allows you to access untested features of the app.

You can open it by `double-tapping with two fingers` on the screen after opening the app,
or by pressing `CTRL+D`.
This opens a new dialog where you can enter the code.

- Currently there are no pre-release secret features.
