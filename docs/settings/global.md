# Global settings
There are two places for configuring global settings:

- The `Global settings` view allows you to change generic settings such as UI scale, scroll behaviour or network interfaces
- The `App settings` view allows you to change settings related to the mixing UI

## Global settings
### Open settings
The app settings can be opened via the menu from the `start view` (directly after opening the app)
```

```

### Update branch
> Desktop version only

Configures which branch to use when checking for updates.

### Scale

### Invert scroll

### Access bus processing
When enabled, a user with restricted access to a single bus is allowed to access the processing of that bus.

### Autostart
Autostart allows you to configure which mixer the app should connect to when starting.
This is useful for installation purposes where the app should always connect to a mixer without user interaction.

### Auto reconnect
When enabled, the app automatically reconnects to the mixer in the case of a connection error.
