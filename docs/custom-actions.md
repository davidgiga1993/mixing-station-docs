## Label tags
It is possible to use dynamic text as a label for UI items.
To do so, use one of the following tags:

| Tag | Action | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `[label]` | Any | Shows a short description of the action |
| `[value]` | Any | Shows the current value of the action |
| `[bpm]` | FX | BPM for 1/4 notes |
| `[sofname]` | Sends on fader | Name of the current bus master |
| `[shortLabel]` | Channel actions | Short version of label |
| `[chname]` | Channel actions | Current name of the channel |
| `[chnum]`  | Channel actions | Channel type + name (e.g. `Mix 01`) |
| `[sendName]` | Channel send actions | Name of the channel send used by the action |
| `[fx]` | FX actions | Name of the FX type |
| `[varname]` | FX actions | Name of FX parameter |

## Channel based actions
These actions can be used to change a value in a channel

- Current channel: Values in the last opened channel can be changed
- Current layer: Values in any channel in the current layer can be changed. Use the "Channel offset" parameter to select which channel of the current layer should be used (1 is the channel on the left)
- Fixed channel: Changes a value in a fixed channel


### Settings: Invert output
The `Invert output` button can be used to invert the output. This might be useful when you want to create a mute button, but the channel only has an "on" function.

### Settings: Use SoF
When activated, the `Fader`, `Pan`, and `On` values will be affected by "sends on fader". When this is disabled, these values will always affect the main mix only.

## FX
Allows FX value changes. This action also has tap delay support for the `time` value of an FX.


## Mutegroup
Changes the status of a mutegroup.

## Open view
Opens a view in the app. Depending on the mixer, there may be more or fewer views available. 
**Note:** No other actions in the list will be executed after this action. If you want for example to change a layer and open a view, place the "open view" action last.

## Sends on fader
Changes the current "sends on fader" status and target mix.


## Show
The show action can load cues, scenes or other show related stuff.
Depending on the current mixer the available actions might change.

### XM32
- Current: Does nothing but has the value of the currently loaded show item
- Go: Loads the item selected as `next`. Has the name of the next item as value
- Next: Moves the `next` selection to the next item. Has the same value as `Go`
- Go+Next: Executes `Go` and then `Next`
- Prev: Moves the "next" selection one item back
- Go+Prev: Executes `Go` and then `Prev`
- Load x: Loads the item as position X
