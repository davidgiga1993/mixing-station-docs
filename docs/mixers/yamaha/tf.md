# Yamaha TF

## Metering

The metering data on the Yamaha TF mixer is sent using `Multicast`. To be able to see the metering data
you'll need to:

- Make sure your device is in the same subnet as the mixer
- Enable `Multicast` traffic on your wifi access point (some devices have this option disabled by default)
