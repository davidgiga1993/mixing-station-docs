# XAir / MAir Series

This page is for the XR and Midas MR series

## Bus password protection

It is possible to lock certain buses with a password (Mixing Station only).

### Usage

1. Open the "Security view": `Menu -> Setup -> Security`
2. Enter a password. The password will be stored in the XAir internal storage and is **NOT** encrypted
3. Select the buses you want to protect. `Main LR` will lock the `No restrictions` mode.
4. Press back to close the view and store the settings on the XAir.

When you connect to the XAir and the data sync is completed, a password prompt will be shown if the bus you want to
access is protected.

### Supported devices

All devices using Mixing Station. Any other app including the official XAir apps will simply ignore this setting.

### Where is the password stored?

The password is stored in the last snapshot (50th position). The scope buttons are used to store the information about
which bus is protected.

### How to reset the password?

Save and then delete the 50th snapshot using any official XAIR-Edit app.
