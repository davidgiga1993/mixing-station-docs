# Bus password protection
It is possible to lock certain buses with a password (Mixing Station only).


## Usage
1. Open the "Security view": `Menu -> Setup -> Security`
2. Enter a password. The password will be stored in the XAir internal storage and is **NOT** encrypted
3. Select the buses you want to protect. `Main LR` will lock the `No restrictions` mode.
4. Press back to close the view and store the settings on the XAir.

When you connect to the XAir and the data sync is completed, a password prompt will be shown if the bus you want to access is protected.

## Supported devices
All devices using Mixing Station. Any other app including the official XAir apps will simply ignore this setting.

## Where is the password stored?
The password is stored in the last snapshot (50th position). The scope buttons are used to store the information about which bus is protected.

## How to reset the password?
Delete the 50th snapshot using any official XAIR-Edit app.
