# Subscription

A subscription will unlock all supported mixers in the app.
The subscription can be imported on up to 4 devices (of any platform).

## Getting started

To ensure the license activation and renewal works smoothly please follow the steps:

1) Create a mixing station account (if you don't have already) with the same email address you received the license confirmation from: [Register account](https://mixingstation.app/profile/create)
2) You should see the license already listed, note that if they do not appear your account might use a different email address.
3) Now you can import the license to your device, for this follow the [Restore license](overview.md#restore-licenses) section and select your Mixing Station account.


## Renewal

Each subscription license has an expiry date which is 1 week after the next billing period. This means you'll need to 
connect to the internet once the next billing period started - with a grace period of 1 week.

This means the longer you chose a license duration, the easier is the renewal process.

The app will remind you about this with a `Licenses renewal required` popup after opening the app.
If a license has been renewed you'll get a `Licenses renewed` popup after opening the app.
