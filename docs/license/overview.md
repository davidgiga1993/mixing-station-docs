Due to different app store policies each platform (iOS, Desktop, Android) has its own licensing system.
Therefore, you **can't** use one license on another platform (e.g. an iOS license on Android).

It is possible to use a single license on multiple devices of the same platform type (e.g. several Android tablets can share one license). See below under [Activation](##Activation) for more information.


## Mixing Station account (Desktop, Android)
All licenses can be managed using your [Mixing Station account](https://dev-core.org/mixing-station/profile/licenses). If you don't have an account yet, you can [register here](https://dev-core.org/mixing-station/profile/create).

Make sure to use the same email address as that used for purchasing, otherwise we can't link the license to your account!

## Activation
Each license can be activated on 4 different devices at the same time. Once the limit has been reached you can either deactivate devices you don't use anymore or purchase another license. This can be done in your Mixing Station account page.

## Restore licenses
The following sections describe how to restore / import a license to another device.

### iOS
Make sure you're logged in with the same Apple id.

As an alternative you can select "restore purchases" in the license page inside the app to restore any previous in-app purchases made with your Google account.
