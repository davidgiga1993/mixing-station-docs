Due to the different app store policies each platform (iOS, Desktop, Android) has it's own licensing system.
Therefore you **can't** use one license on another platform (e.g. an iOS license on Android).

It is possible to use one license on multiple devices of the same platform (e.g. multiple Android tablets).



## Mixing Station account (Desktop, Android)
All licenses can be managed using your [Mixing Station account](https://dev-core.org/mixing-station/profile/licenses). If you don't have an account yet, you can [register here](https://dev-core.org/mixing-station/profile/create).

Make sure to use the same email address as used for purchasing otherwise we can't link the license to your account!

## Activation
Each license can be activated on 4 different devices at the same time. Once the limit has been reached you can either deactivate devices you don't use anymore or purchase another license. This can be done on your Mixing Station account page.

## Restore licenses
The following describes how to restore / import the license on another device.

### iOS
Make sure you're logged in with the same Apple id.

As an alternative you can select "restore purchases" in the license page inside the app to restore any previous in-app purchases made with your Google account.
