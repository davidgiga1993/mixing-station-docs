# General

## Mixer specific settings

The X32 series has some mixer specific settings in Mixing Station. Those can be found 
in the [app setup -> mixer](../settings/app.md) view. 

### Follow X

There are various settings to follow the current selected channel or view.

When enabling the `Follow ch select` option, the app will follow the currently selected channel on the mixer.
This means if you're selecting a different channel in the app, it might revert back to the channel selected on the mixer-side.

This means you'll need either to disable the follow option when using mixing station standalone, or also enable `Mixer follow Ch select`
which will update the channel selection on the mixer side when you change it in Mixing Station.
