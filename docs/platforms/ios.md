# iOS

For iOS, only one app is distributed. This app can control all mixers and is only available as a "pro" edition.
You can use all features of the app in the offline mode for free.
As soon as you want to connect to a mixer you must buy the app for that mixer model.

## Requirements
- iOS >= 9
- iPhone, iPad (project catalyst is not supported)

## URL Scheme
The URL scheme of the app is `mixingstation`. This name can be used for other apps such as `BandHelper` in order to open Mixing Station.
