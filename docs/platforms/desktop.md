## Licensing

After purchasing a license you will receive a download link to a license file. Make sure to keep a backup of your
license files in case of data loss!

You can import the license into the app via the license page:
![menu](../img/license/pc-menu.png)
Either select `Mixing Station account` or `from file`
![menu](../img/license/pc-file-import.png)
Then select your license file

## Scaling

Mixing Station tries to honor the scaling option of the OS.
If for whatever reason the UI is too large to too small you can manually adjust the scaling in the global app settings.
See [settings](../settings/global.md) for more details
