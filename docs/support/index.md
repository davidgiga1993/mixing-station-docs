# Support

Mixing Station is developed by a single person, thus I can't provide
in-depth support for every customer.

If you need help it's best to post your issue on one of the social media platforms (see bottom left
on [https://mixingstation.app/](https://mixingstation.app/)).

We're a pretty big community by now and many people are happy to help.

In case you're having issues with licenses or your account, please contact support@mixingstation.app directly.


If you found a bug in the app, please report it [on the help page](https://mixingstation.app/help). 
Make sure to read the instructions!
